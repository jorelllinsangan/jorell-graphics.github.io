 **********************************************************************/
Keep one of the 3 options below, and delete the other two. The intention of this
is that nobody receives a grade that's way out of line with expectations
due to technical difficulties.
 
i. Box with supports and a top: (Fully Completed)
ii. Console, joystick, guards and prize bin: (Fully Completed)
iii. Arrow keys cause joystick to bend: (Fully Completed)
iv: Claw mechanism, created in a hierarchical manner: (Fully Completed)
v: Keyboard allows claw to move (in xz plane): (Fully Completed) use WASD
vi: Spacebar drops claw (in y plane): (Fully Completed)
vii. Pressing "v" changes viewpoint: (Fully Completed)

/**********************************************************************
 * List any additional comments that you feel may be relevant.

So it says in the assignment that the arrow keys should move the claw but the arrow keys are used to move the camera around. I'm using WASD instead to move the claw.
